#  Book List ✍️ 
## Overview 📝
The Book List project is a JavaScript mini project.
AS the name implies, the app is used to enter books in a list format.
It shows the title, author and isbn number.
## Aim 🎯
The primary objectives of this project were to learn OOP style.
To understand the ES5 OOP style.
To understand the ES6 OOP style.
## Features 📃
The app is made up with the following features
* Input fields for title, author, and isbn number of the book.
* A submit button with a click event that invokes the functions to add the book to list
* Form validation that prevents the user from adding book with incomplete data,
which alerts the message "Please fill in all fields" in red color alert box.
* A success message when a user adds a book to list or delete a book from the list.
The success message appears in a green background alert box.
* The added book can also be stored in the local storage in the browser.

## Acknowledgement 🙏
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Brad Traversy for developing this course.
His consices approach to tutorials is what made the course very much interesting.
His explanation of the concepts was a syntatic sugar, just like the ES6 classes.

#  GitHub User Finder ✍️ 
## Overview 📝
The GitHub User Finder as the name implies is a simple web app that
can be used to find registered GitHub Users. The app was built using
using GitHub public API, by making fetch request to the API. This app
was writen using modern JavaScript ECMA specifications: ES6 and ES7.
Apart from finding a GitHub User, it equally displays some information
about the user.
